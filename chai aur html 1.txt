Button color change is preferred over button size increase on hover as reflow takes up more computation as compared to paint

html does two things, rendering the website and user input

browser only understands html, css and js

Stylesheet is for styling and cascading means to overwrite, so using css we overwrite(not exactly) the user agent stylesheet (browser ki stylesheet)

overwrite matlab sab ku karna 
cascade matlab jo style likhre, wahi overwrite karta user agent stylesheet ku

Inline css
<tagname style="prop:value; prop:value">content</tagname>
<h1 style="color:red;background-color:blue">Hello</h1>

inline css is easy to share and easy to read

Internal Css - inside the file only, hard to share
<head>
<style>
styles come here
</style>
</head>

External css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> in <head> tag

internal css comes after external css

multiple classes can have the same element and vice versa (class=class1 class2) but neither of it holds true for id

cascading happens based on (line+priority) -> lower line in case of tie else inline,#,.,element,*
!important
